## Description:
##     Default configuration for the user (and password) used for testing
##   The "ndexTestConf" object is a simple list, which must have the following proberties defined:
##      user:                 User name
##      password:             Corresponding user password
##      uuidPrivateNetwork: UUID of a private network (owned by the defined user, shared with a group) to perform some (network changing) tests on
##      uuidPublicNetwork:     UUID of a public network (usually from "ndextutorials") to perform some read-only tests
##      uuidGroup:            UUID of a (private) group, to that the specified user belongs
##   Furthermore, the user must own a network, which is shared with the group!
##
## Usage:
##  devtools::test(filter='05_*')
